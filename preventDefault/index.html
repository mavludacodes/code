      /* Actually, if you watch closely, you'll see that it does log but then we get a
         full page refresh. We can prove that by turning on preserve log. We say Joe
         again, hit submit, we get submitted and then navigated to that page. 
         
         Now, the reason that this is happening is because when you submit a form 
         in the browser, it automatically makes a post request to the current URL with 
         the form data. We could see that if we looked at our network tab. 
         
         If you want to do some JavaScript stuff based on the user's submitted form, 
         then we don't want the full page refresh. Instead, we can do our own JavaScript stuff. 
         
         The handleSubmit function as an event handler will accept an event as the argument. 
         Then we can say event.preventDefault. With that, we will no longer get a full 
         page refresh and we'll still get the submitted string logged to the console.
