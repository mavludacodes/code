                </li>

            </ul>

            <p>
              Here, we have a list of each one of these items, where the item
              itself is the label and then the default value for the input is
              the item as well. Then we can remove these and add them. As I
              removed them, if you watched carefully, you might have noticed an
              interesting bug.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I click on remove here and remove and remove and remove,
              everything works out just fine. If I remove from the beginning,
              now we're having orange being associated to the apple. Grape is
              associated to orange. Pear is associated to grape. That's
              interesting.
            </p>

            <p>
              If I remove from the middle here, now we have pear is associated
              to orange. Orange is associated to apple. Things are all kinds of
              messed up. This is the bug that the key prop helps you to avoid.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you consider what happens when we click this remove button or
              this add button, then this strange behavior will make sense. When
              we click on removeItem, for example, if we try to remove the
              grape, then that goes into this code right here, which calls
              setItems. That sets the items to the same list of items that we
              had before, except we're filtering out the item that you were
              trying to remove.
            </p>

            <p>
              This call to setItems is going to trigger a re-render of our app.
              The app is going to come down here. We're going to create these
              React elements. We're going to iterate over this list of items,
              which now has one less item than it had before. We're going to
              hand that off to React so that it can update the DOM
              appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way React updates the DOM is it has a reference to the JSX
              elements that you gave it the last time it rendered this app
              component. It compares those React elements with the new React
              elements that you just returned at this time. Then it updates the
              DOM accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you're giving it an array of React elements, unless React has
              some sort of identifier to know which element is which, it doesn't
              know whether you removed an element or maybe you added three and
              removed four or maybe you changed the order and just removed the
              first one.
            </p>

            <p>
              It doesn't have any insight into what it is that you did to this
              array of React elements between the last time it rendered and this
              time. Any time you're rendering an array of React elements, you
              need to give it a key so that it can determine whether elements
              were removed, added, or modified.
            </p>

            <p>
              That's why providing a unique key for each one of these items is
              going to fix this problem. Now, if we click remove on the grape,
              all of the inputs and their labels are correct.
