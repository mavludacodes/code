            <p>
              Another mistake that I see people make sometimes is they try to
              use the index as the key. While you get rid of the warning, you do
              not get rid of the bugs. That's because as React is comparing the
              previous version with the new version, what you're saying is the
              element that was at index four is actually now at index three, but
              React doesn't know that.
            </p>
            <p>
              It maintains the state for this input to be the same as the one
              that was at index three the last time rather than being the one
              that was in index four last time. It's important that you keep the
              key as something that's unique to the item that this element in
              the array is representing.
            </p>

              Here's another little demo that I have at the bottom of this file.
              I'm just going to uncomment that. We'll save this. We'll get a
              refresh. In this example, we have those items. Every 1,000
              milliseconds, we have this interval that shuffles those items and
              triggers a re-render with that shuffled version of the items. We
              randomize the items every time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have three versions of this, one that renders those items as
              inputs without a key, another that renders those items with inputs
              with the key of index, and then the last that renders those items
              with an appropriate key. You'll notice that they're all updating
              correctly, meaning that they're all jumping around the screen as
              they should, but the focus is not updating correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm focused on apple right now. When that one moves, my focus
              doesn't go around with apple. Also, if I try to highlight one of
              these, then my highlight goes away as well. You'll notice that the
              With Key as Index suffers from the exact same problem. Even though
              it's not getting the warning in the console, you're still not
              fixing this bug.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only when you have a key in there will your focus travel around
              with the input that it's associated with, because React is able to
              determine where to move the focus as your component updates.
