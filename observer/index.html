      <p class="text-base mb-[5px]">
        Material UI is an open-source React component library that implements
        Google's Material Design. It includes a comprehensive collection of
        prebuilt components that are ready for use in production right out of
        the box. Material UI is beautiful by design and features a suite of
        customization options that make it easy to implement your own custom
        design system on top of our components.

      <ul class="text-base">
        <li>
          Ship faster: Over 2,500 open-source contributors have poured countless
          hours into these components. Focus on your core business logic instead
          of reinventing the wheel—we've got your UI covered.
        </li>
        <li>
          Beautiful by default: we're meticulous about our implementation of
          Material Design, ensuring that every Material UI component meets the
          highest standards of form and function, but diverge from the official
          spec where necessary to provide multiple great options.
        </li>
        <li>
          Customizability: the library includes an extensive set of intuitive
          customizability features. The templates in our store demonstrate how
          far you can go with customization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cross-team collaboration: Material UI's intuitive developer experience
          reduces the barrier to entry for back-end developers and less
          technical designers, empowering teams to collaborate more effectively.
          The design kits streamline your workflow and boost consistency between
          designers and developers.

      <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-[40px]">Material UI vs. Base UI</h1>
      <p class="text-base">
        Material UI and Base UI feature many of the same UI components, but Base
        UI comes without any default styles or styling solutions. Material UI is
        comprehensive in that it comes packaged with default styles, and is
        optimized to work with Emotion (or styled-components). Base UI, by
        contrast, could be considered the "skeletal" or "headless" counterpart
        to Material UI—in fact, future versions of Material UI will use Base UI
        components and hooks for its foundational structure.
